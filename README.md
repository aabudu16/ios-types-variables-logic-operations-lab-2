//2. You are given a number. Print even if the number is even or odd otherwise.

//5. You are working on a smart-fridge. The smart-fridge knows how old the eggs and bacon in it are. You know that eggs spoil after 3 weeks (21 days) and bacon after one week (7 days). Given baconAge and eggsAge (both in days) determine if you can cook bacon and eggs, or which ingredients you need to throw out. If you can cook bacon and eggs, print "you can cook bacon and eggs". If you need to throw out any ingredients, for each one print a line with the text "throw out" + bacon or eggs.

//6 .You are given a year, determine if itâ€™s a leap year. A leap year is a year containing an extra day. It has 366 days instead of the normal 365 days. The extra day is added in February, which has 29 days instead of the normal 28 days. Leap years occur every 4 years. 2012 was a leap year and 2016 will also be a leap year. The above rule is valid except that every 100 years special rules apply. Years that are divisible by 100 are not leap years if they are not also divisible by 400. For example 1900 was not a leap year, but 2000 was. Print "Leap year!" or "Not a leap year!" depending on the year you are provided.
